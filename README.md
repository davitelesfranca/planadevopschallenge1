## Quickstart 

The following steps are using K3D tool to run Kubernetes. You can use another as your preference like Minikube, MicroK8s, etc.

To run in our own environment:

1. Fork the project to your own repository;
2. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
3. Install kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl
4. Install k3d: https://k3d.io/v5.4.1/#installation.
5. k3d cluster create NAME_YOUR_CLUSTER -p "8080:30000@loadbalancer"
6. kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
7. In your browser you can access http://0.0.0.0:8080 or curl 0.0.0.0:8080 and you will receive the desired out of this challenge:



```json
{
  "timestamp": "<current date and time>",
  "hostname": "<Name of the host (IP also accepted)>",
  "engine": "<Name and/or version of the engine running>",
  "visitor ip": "<the IP address of the visitor>"
}
```
   
In deployment.yaml's line 44 the port type of service is set to NodePort, because that was created to be tested in a local enviroment. if you're using a public environment (cloud, for instance), please, change it to loadBalancer:


From:  
(...)
    type: NodePort   
To:  
(...)
    type: loadBalancer
